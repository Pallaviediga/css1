<h2>PROJECTS</h2> <hr><hr>
<h4><bo>Secure QR Code Scanner to Detect Malicious URL Using Machine Learning.</bo></h4> 
 The project aims to develop a QR code scanner that ensures user safety by detec ng malicious URLs. <br> 
 When a QR code is scanned, the embedded URL is extracted automa cally. <br> 
 The URL is analysed for various features like domain reputa on, URL length, and presence of suspicious   pa erns. <br> 
 Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) are used to classify URLs as safe or malicious.  <br>
 Training data consists of labelled URLs, both malicious and benign, to help the model learn effec vely.  <br>
 Feature engineering plays a key role in improving the model’s accuracy and reducing false posi ves.  <br>
 The system warns users if the scanned URL is poten ally harmful before they proceed.  <br>
 It prevents automa c redirec on to unsafe websites, reducing the risk of phishing and malware a acks.  <br>
 Integra on with threat intelligence sources and blacklists improves detec on performance. <br> 
 User data and scanning ac vity are handled securely, ensuring privacy and trust. <br> 
 The scanner is designed to be lightweight and easy to use on mobile or desktop pla orms. <br> 
 Overall, the project enhances cybersecurity using AI-powered real-me threat detec on.
